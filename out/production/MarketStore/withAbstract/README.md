It's a Java console application that can be run as executable jar 
or from IDE of your choice. The entry point is in Main.java. 

When you start the app you would be asked to enter an integer number 
representing how many purchases you want to input. Then you would be asked
to enter sequentially the type of the card (b for bronze, s for silver and
 g for gold, only small letters are excepted), the turnover of the card
 for the previous month (only positive numbers >= 0) and the purchase value
 (only positive numbers) for each purchase.
